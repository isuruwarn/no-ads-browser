No Ads Browser Web
==================

This is the web version of the No Ads Browser, which is a sandbox for viewing the content of a web page (articles, blogs) without streaming advertisements, popups, banners, etc. It's like a browser inside a browser. It works by removing any javascript, iframes, canvas tags and many other tags, therefore provides a safe environment for viewing a web page content.
