No Ads Browser Swing
====================

This is the desktop version of the No Ads Browser, which is a sandbox for viewing the content of a web page (articles, blogs) without streaming advertisements, popups, banners, etc. This application utilizes the HTML renderer provided by Swing. It removes any javascript, iframes, canvas tags and many other tags, therefore provides a safe environment for viewing a web page content.
